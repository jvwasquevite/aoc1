## About The Project

This repository was created to store and organize some theoretical and pratical exercises developed for MIPS processor, using concepts learned from Computer Architecture and Organization I classes

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*  <a href="https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm">MARS simulator</a>

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jvwasquevite/aoc1.git
   ```
2. Open `.asm` files on <a href="https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/download.htm">MARS simulator</a> to assemble and run

## Contributing

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
